# RÂ·CONVERT

A live demo of this project runs at [rconvert.netlify.app](https://rconvert.netlify.app).

The App pulls data from an API managed by the European Central Bank.
It includes a search bar to add currencies and has a drag and drop functionality to move currencies up and down the list. You can also remove currencies from the list. The settings are saved in local storage.

The currency items in the list display an image of the currencies country. The images are pulled from Unsplash and are delivered by Cloudinary with the width and height needed for the clients display.
